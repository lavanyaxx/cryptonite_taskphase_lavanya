# HELLO HACKERS 

## INTRO TO COMMANDS

In this challenge we just had to invoke the "hello" command and capture the flag.

## INTRO TO ARGUMENTS 

In this challenge we learnt about arguments, which get printed when written after a command.

```hello hackers```

In this hello is the command and hackers is the argument and hence hackers will get printed.
