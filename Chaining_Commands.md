# CHAINING COMMANDS

## CHAINING WITH SEMICOLONS

This can be done using a semicolon(;)

In this challenge we had to chain /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college:

```/challenge/pwn;/challenge/college```

## FIRST SHELL SCRIPT

We can make a shell script and execute it by using the following commands :

```nano x.sh```

```chmod +x x.sh```

```bash x.sh```

## REDIRECTING SCRIPT OUTPUT

This can be done by the following command:

```bash x.sh | /challenge/solve```

## EXECUTABLE SHELL SCRIPT

We can avoid the need to manually invoke bash. 

If our shell script file is executable ,we can simply invoke it via its relative or absolute path.

In this challenge we had to make the shell script executable and invoke it via its relative path.

```./k.sh```
